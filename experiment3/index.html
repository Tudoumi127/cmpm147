				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?:
					We were trying to make a somehwat RPG/dungeon crawler esque style. We started with a lot of ideas
					on how we wanted to put a unique stylistic touch on this project but unforntanetly much trial and error
					led to us running out of time. But it is very quaint and cute, and the scrolling generation is neat.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?
					I worked together with Jaxon Ruiz on this, I was mostly working on overworld. The tile generation
					is randomized through perlin noise. The noise making function is called in a loop, and for each value
					that it generated, there is a switch case checking if the value is less than 0.2, less than 0.4, less than 0.7
					etc and depending on the value- the tile is filled accordingly. We then used autotiling to smooth out the scene
					by having a function that loops through and checks various edge cases and replaces tiles with transition tiles
					at points where two types of terrain make contact.

				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.
					I think we had big dreams for this assignmetn and inevitably ran into difficulties and ran out of time. I think
					we definitely would have benefitted from either starting earlier or starting from a smaller scope considering we
					did a lot of experimenting with things we did not even end up implementing. Originally we did not have the overworld being
					generated by perlin noise, instead it was simply switch cases and randoms and I struggled a lot with trying to make coherent
					landmarks and features. Figuring out how noise and autotiling work was definitely the highlight of this experiment.
