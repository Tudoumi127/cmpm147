				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>What are you trying to acomplish with this experiment?</p>
				<p>I wanted to mimic the feeling of a field sprouting flowers. The flowers appear when the screen is clicked and fade on their own.
					I tried to make it so the flower locations would be random with each click but since the random was tied to the random seed,
					I couldn't really find a way to make it work. But I did add an extra blue flower that spawned at a random size wherever the cursor clicked.

				</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>Describe in detail what you did technically and how it works?</p>
				<p>I based my code off of the example provided, the mountains were made using the same createShape process but with differen parameters.
					The flowers were also mostly based off the example living impression, but I also made a flowerFlag that when true (turns true on click) would spawn flowers
					on click and added a counter that decremented their opacity over time to make them slowly fade away. I looked it up and max opacity in p5js
					is 255, so in the for loop for the flowers, I had it decrement from 255 and once the opacity hit 0 or less, it would change the flowerFlag to false.
					In the mousePressed function I would reset it to true so that the user could click as many times as they wanted.

					If the user hits "reimagine", a different random number is chosen and it will regenerate the landscape and the flower locations accordingly.

				</p>

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>Each person that worked on the code should reflect on the process, the difficulties, and the successes of the experiment.</p>
				<p>I worked on this project myself but I got some help from a friend to figure out how to use the mousePressed function, mostly because I was trying to use mouseClicked and it wasn't working. 
					I also got a lot of code from the example living impression provided. I think the most difficult part was trying to figure out a way
					to make the flowers spawn at completely random locations with every click instead of only being able to change their spawn locations by hitting "reimagine". 
					I was not able to figure that out but I think I could if I had more time, or at least find some completely different way of going about it. I also changed
					it so that canvas is an object and that only clicks registered inside the canvas would spawn flowers because I didn't like how clicking "reimagine" would spawn flowers. Other than that
					 though I was able to successfully figure out how to make the flowers spawn on click and fade over time so I consider it a success.
