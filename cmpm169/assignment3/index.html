			<h1>CMPM169 Assignment 3</h1>
			<p>Pixelation filter + Blur</p>
			<p>Click to swap images (I drew them myself :D)</p>
            <p>Moving cursor to the left keeps the base image clear, moving it to the right blurs it</p>
            <p>The pixelation effect goes down the image slowly row by row of pixels so you can play around with some very weird combos of pixelation on blurred and non blurred parts</p>
            <p>I originally wanted to create a glitch filter that added a ton of noise to the image to make it recognizable only through color blocks, but halfway through playing around and looking at references I ended up with this and thought it looked cool. It is kind of like a noise effect, except it feels like it turns the original image into the noise instead of just adding it on top</p>
            <p>I wasn't expecting the pixelation to be so hard to notice when the base image is blurred, but it ended up being pretty neat because by moving your mouse left and right you can make lines of blur and lines of pixel</p>
