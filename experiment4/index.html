				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>To be honest for this world specifically I didn't have a picture reference, I just really like black/white/red color schemes
                    and also really like birds. So I thought it would be neat to have a black and white city scape with red birds. For world 1
                    however, I was going for a somewhat cyberpunk-esque look and I think I was able to achieve it with the color scheme and lighting.
                    World 3 on the other hand was a bit of a failure, I was trying to make a city scape that changed colors randomly depending on cursor location,
                    somewhat inspired by those heat sensing monitors, but I couldn't figure it out so now it just lightens the area around the cursor.

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>I mostly built around the base code given. But I used perlin noise to generate the tiles instead of random. For the building structures used in all 3 worlds, I used hashed random in order to create the 
                    variable "offsetHeight" and added it onto the Y variable for walls. This way the height of each building is randomized. For the lighting 
                    used in worlds 1 and 3, I made a variable "distanceFromMouse" that used math functions to calculate distance from cursor. Then I used that value to
                    calculate a tint that would multiply the color values of tiles a certain distance from the cursor by a set amount to change their colors. In this case
                    the tint makes them lighter. Thank you Jaxon Ruiz for help figuring the tint out.

				<h2>Reflection</h2>
				<p>This assignment was rather difficult for me because I didn't really understand the material. I spent a lot of time just trying to figure out what the 
                    base code was doing. Making the buildings and especially the birds was also a pain because getting the right values was a long process. I think implementing noise
                    was the smoothest part of the process for me.
